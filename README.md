## Goals 

1. Automate celltype annotations process; predict celltype labels with high accuracy.
2. Remove technical variation across batches while preserving biological variation.

## File hierarchy

- `devel_*` contain scripts under development
- `scripts` contain pipelines that are more mature
- `meeting_note.md` is literally the meeting note...
